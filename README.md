# Python Data Analysis Exercises with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib

In this repository I've compiled a series of exercises that I completed to deepen my understanding of essential Python libraries for data analysis: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Through these hands-on tasks, I explored a wide range of topics in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, which are fundamental for any data analysis project.

can also be found in the repository.

## What I Learned:
### NumPy:

 - I gained proficiency in using multidimensional arrays (`ndarray`) and explored their capabilities for handling large datasets efficiently.
 - I practiced performing mathematical and logical operations on arrays, which are crucial for data processing tasks.
 - I developed skills in advanced indexing, array reshaping, and transposition, allowing me to manipulate data in versatile ways.
 - I worked with 3D arrays and applied conditional logic using numpy.where, which enhanced my ability to handle complex data structures.

### Pandas:

 - I became comfortable working with Pandas' Series and DataFrames, mastering the core data structures that underpin most data analysis workflows.
 - I learned to handle missing data, align data automatically, and perform type inference, which are critical for ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
 - I practiced various techniques for selecting, filtering, and sorting data, enabling me to manage and explore datasets effectively.
 - I delved into grouping, aggregating, and merging data, which equipped me with the tools to analyze data relationships and patterns.
 - I utilized `apply()` and `map()` functions to apply operations across datasets efficiently, and I explored advanced methods like concatenation, merging, and pivoting for combining and reshaping data.

### Matplotlib:

 - I honed my skills in creating and customizing visualizations using Matplotlib, from simple static plots to interactive figures.
 - I experimented with PyPlot to adjust line attributes, manage figures and axes, and build complex visualizations tailored to different data insights.
 - I incorporated text labels, titles, and annotations into my plots, making them more informative and publication-ready.
- I also explored building histograms and adjusting axes scales, which are essential for presenting data distributions and trends.
